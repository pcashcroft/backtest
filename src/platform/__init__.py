INSTRUCTION HEADER
What this file does: Defines the platform package and its public surface.
Where it runs: Imported by other Python modules (not a standalone script).
Inputs: None.
Outputs: Provides the `platform` package namespace for imports.
How to run: Not run directly. Import from other code.
Also (if needed): `C:\\Users\\pcash\\anaconda3\\envs\\platform\\python.exe -c "import platform; print(platform.__all__)"`
Success looks like: imports work without errors.
Common failures + fixes: Module not found -> run from repo root or add `src` to `PYTHONPATH`.
